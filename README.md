# easy-bnn-with-tf2.0
Here I put some implementations of Bayesian Neural Networks using Keras, TensorFlow Probability and TensorFlow 2.0. It is being used as a personal repo for me to learn about htis wonderful theme. 

### First of all, the TF and TFP versions for my implementation:
As TensorFlow Perobability is having some issues on gathering gradients on neural networks, and I had a lot of work in searching for a solution, I'm putting it here for if you want to reproduce this code. On the GitHub issue, I was told to use the TensorFlow Proability Nightly version, as this one had no gradient issue for this use case.

So, for it to be easier, use TFP in this exact version, and TF 2.0 if you want to use Gradient Tape and @tf.function

TensorFlow version: 2.0.0-beta1
TensorFlow Probability version: 0.9.0-dev20190912
