    "\n",
    "Despite being very accurate and able to model (with the right hyperparameters) any kind of mathematical function, NNs do operate with any kind of data (if encoded in a tensor according to its input shape). For illustration purposes, it means that, on the case of a image-classifier CNN, once I've encoded an image as a tensor as the same of its input, I'm able to try to predict its label even if my image has nothing to see with my classificator purpose. It also means that, even when I'm trying to predict a very noisy image (which can almos be seen as noise), the network will output a deterministic prediction for it (** see point 3. for illustration**). \n",
    "\n",
    "We understand that it would be nice to know how certain our network is of its prediction. For example, in an autonomous car, it should be mandatory to have threshold on which, even if it does not recognize a pedestrian, depending on the uncertanity of its prediction, the car acts as if there was one. This goes for many examples on sensible decisions on which life is involved. \n",
